        <p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
            This extension is made by Thomas de Luca. <br />
            I made the extension because I wanted to enter giveaways more quickly. I was fed up by clicking on every giveaway, then clicking on "Enter giveaway" and closing the tab. <br />
            Because I couldn't find any extensions that semi-automated this proces for me, I saw it as an opportunity to learn how to write a basic extension *and* to automate the proces of entering giveaways. <br />
            Now, this extension is far from perfect. But it does it's job well enough for me.
        </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First of all, activate this extension before you visit the Steamgifts website.</li>
                <li>Open giveaways in new tabs. The extension automatically enters the giveaways for you.</li>
                <li>When you run out of points the extension alerts you with a pop-up.</li>
                <li>Click on the extension icon and then on "Close ALL Giveaway-tabs". This will close all the open giveaway tabs.</li>
                <li>???</li>
                <li>Profit!</li>
            </ol>
            If there are 0 open giveaway tabs, the button shows "Visit Steamgifts website".<br />If there are open giveaway tabs it shows "Close ALL open giveaway-tabs".

            <h3>Security</h3>
            This app does *not* collect any user info. Don't worry about your steamaccount, it's safe since I'm not that good at coding extensions.<br />
            If you're a suspicious type, open the files of this extension and take a look at the souce code.
